[RST beyond discourse markers](https://sites.google.com/view/rst-poetisa/the-project) (current): 
The project is structured into two main phases: (i) revisiting and analyzing the RST annotation of the CSTNews corpus and reviewing existing work in BP; and (ii) conducting a study of RST annotation to identify new linguistic cues for marking rhetorical discourse relations, inspired by Das and Taboada (2019) for English. 

Through these activities, we aim to expand the project to include initiatives that enhance linguistic resources in RST for Portuguese, proposing computational applications and comparative studies of rhetorical relations between BP and other natural languages.
